**TODO**<br>
**Take the length of the triangle as input. DataType will be integer or can be float**<br>
**Need to check if the value of any two sides sum is grater than the other side or not.**<br>
**If any two sides sum is grater than other one then it will be a triangle. Else not(Pretty much dumb logic!)**
