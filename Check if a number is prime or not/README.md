# Check if a number is prime or not<br>
**TODO**<br>
**Take a number as input, DataType will be integer and tell user to give input as positive number**<br>
**Set a counter flag to 0 so it will assume if flag is 0 then it is prime, if it changes its value then it's not a prime number.**<br>
**Fix 0 and 1 to not prime number**<br>
**Use for loop and start count from 2**<br>
